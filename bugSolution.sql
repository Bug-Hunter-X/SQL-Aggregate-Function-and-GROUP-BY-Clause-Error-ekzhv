The solution involves ensuring that all columns selected in the `SELECT` statement that are not aggregated using functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, etc., are explicitly included in the `GROUP BY` clause.

The corrected query (demonstrated in `bugSolution.sql`) is:

```sql
SELECT customerID, SUM(orderTotal) AS totalOrderValue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customerID;
```

This version correctly groups the results by `customerID` and sums the `orderTotal` for each customer.  Alternatively, if you need to include the `orderDate`, you'll need to add that column to the `GROUP BY` clause as well.

```sql
SELECT customerID, orderDate, SUM(orderTotal) AS totalOrderValue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customerID, orderDate;
```
This addresses the original error by correctly aligning the `SELECT` list with the `GROUP BY` clause, eliminating the ambiguity and the resulting error.
